## 🧠 How it works

This app uses a **local voice trigger engine** to detect a customizable wake-word (e.g., “Jarvis”) with minimal CPU usage.

Under the hood, it employs a mechanism inspired by [microWakeWord](https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord):

- 🎤 Continuously listens for wake-word in a low-power, offline fashion.
- 📈 Converts incoming audio into **MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)** features.
- 🤖 Uses a compact **neural network** to determine if the spoken audio matches the wake-word.
- 🚦When triggered, it invokes the **system assistant intent** linked to the official ChatGPT app.

By setting our app as the **default digital assistant**, we enable ChatGPT to launch with voice interaction capabilities, using Android’s native assistant APIs.

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Install the app** and set it as the default digital assistant.
2. **Enable voice trigger**, and choose your preferred wake word (e.g., “Jarvis”).
3. Make sure the official **ChatGPT app** is installed.
4. Enjoy hands-free interaction with ChatGPT, anywhere, anytime.
